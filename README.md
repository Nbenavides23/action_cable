### Introduction to Action Cable and WebSockets  ###
<p> Action Cable seamlessly integrates WebSockets with the rest of the Rails application. It allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the same style and form as the rest of the Rails application, while still being performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have access to your full domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of choice.</p>

<p>WebSockets are a protocol built on top of TCP. They hold the connection to the server open so that the server can send information to the client, even in the absence of a request from the client. WebSockets allow for bi-directional, "full-duplex" communication between the client and the server by creating a persistent connection between the two.</p>
