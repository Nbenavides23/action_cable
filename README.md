### Introduction ###
Action Cable seamlessly integrates WebSockets with the rest of the Rails application. It allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the same style and form as the rest of the Rails application, while still being performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have access to your full domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of choice.
